                        <p>This is one of my latest E-commerce websites, created in Wordpress.
                            The design/layout is user friendly and easy to navigate with the right amount
                            of white spacing. The website also makes use of some useful plugins such as
                            a ajax search bar and Woocommerce. 
                        </p>

                        <img class="thumbnail" src="Media/currency_converter.png" alt="Currency Converter">
                        <p>The currency converter is pretty self-explanatory, as it allows the user to 
                            determine the value of one currency in terms of another. I created this website
                            whilst back in college as an assignment. The navigation has a cool design to it 
                            with the logo placed center. The website was created using HTML, CSS & JS.  </p>

                        <img class="thumbnail" src="Media/PS_Site.png" alt="Playstation">
                        <p>This is the Playstation 5 redesign website. The design was simple by having the
                            more important products centered, to catch the users attention. Also the product
                            images were animated and had a cool feature that spun them 360°. The website also
                            makes use of JS to calculate how much each and every product would cost if selected.

                        <p>This is also another redesign website which offers programming courses to users.
                            Creating this website was very fun with all the different colours and fonts being
                            utilized. The original website is really cool with the light and dark mode features,
                            but also has large UI features and can be overwhelming for some users.

                        <p>Another E-commerce website, this time its summer time! The products were very unique
                            and well designed. My favourite part about creating this website was the product
                            carousel, it was abit challenging for me but i tried something new and my skills 
                            kept getting better from here.

                        <p>Last but not least... my first ever Portfolio website. I created this website at the
                            end of my first year in college and looking back at it now im so proud of myself. Sure 
                            it wasnt all that but it was a milestone for me and reminds me of how far i have come.
                            This was pure HTML and CSS, the coolest part for me at the time was creating the little 
                            cube at the top that was animated. It was used to catch the users attention by spinning
                            and rolling from to right.
